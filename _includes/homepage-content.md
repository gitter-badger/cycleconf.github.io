We are excited to announce the worlds first Cycle.js conference in Copenhagen, the cycling capital of Europe.

We are organizing this conference to connect cyclists from around the world, for a time of tech talks and presentations, and making a space for focused contributions upon Cycle.js and its ecosystem.

## Venue

[Rainmaking Loft Copenhagen](http://www.rainmakingloft.dk) is our proud partner and will be providing the venue for our event. This community of 300+ entrepreneurs is housed within a unique, cultural landmark building from 1888 that used to serve the Danish navy. Nearby neighbors include the creative education hub of Copenhagen and the city's Opera House overlooking the harbor. They support tech startups by providing them with a highly inspiring work environment at an affordable price.

## Host

[Rise Digital](http://risedigital.dk) is hosting the event and taking care of all the practical things not related to the venue. CycleConf is a community effort, and the organizers are open to input and helping hands. If you can help Rise Digital organize CycleConf in any way, please don't hesitate to contact [aron@risedigital.dk](mailto:aron@risedigital.dk)

## Tickets

We want CycleConf to be accessible and affordable.
Therefor we are proud to announce 99 € ticket price.
We will cover most conference expenses through sponsorships, if you are interested in sponsoring CycleConf please contact [negin@risedigital.dk](mailto:negin@risedigital.dk) for details.

Tickets will go on sale soon.

## Scale

Cycle.js is still in its infancy, our aim is to organize a small and focused conference. We are setting the initial limit at 50 participants. In case of insane demand we may consider moving to a bigger venue and making a bigger event.

## Accommodation

We are unable to provide hosting for participants. Copenhagen has many hotels, hostels and Cosy Airbnb apartments, and friendly couch-surfing hosts.

## Speakers

We are still looking for speakers, if you are interested to speak during the conference please contact aron@risedigital.dk to introduce yourself and detail the topic of your presentations.

So far the confirmed speakers are:
[André Staltz](https://github.com/staltz) (RxJS core contributor, Creator of Cycle.js)

There will also be a lightning talk time slots where you have 8 minutes to present something cool related to Cycle.JS. You can register on-site for the lightning talks during the conference.


## Hacking

In addition to the speakers CycleConf wants to give participants a space to hack together and make the Cycle.js ecosystem even better. After the opening keynote there will be an opportunity to present your Cycle.js project, so other participants can join your team. We hope CycleConf will be a great space for connecting people around projects and new projects can emerge from our conference.
